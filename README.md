Built using Java (Java SE 18.0. 2.1), for desktop, the user has to guess numbers between 1 and 5.  

Built to test the knowledge I possess and make the learning process more fun so that I keep consistency. 

A GUI-based project with the swing library to organize all the elements that work under the Number Guessing Game.



All the files are attached above (Learnt this using YouTube and Google and applied the knowledge soon trying to build a project completely built by me without watching any tutorials or looking out for any codes online) 

P.S - Taking help from the community or searching on Google for help isn't a bad thing obviously but i just want to fulfill my desire.

Thank You !
